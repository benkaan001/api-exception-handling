## TO-DOs:

1. `Identify potential error scenarios`: Review the code to identify where errors could occur. In this case, it is important to note that exceptions can be raised either by SQLite or Python libraries.

2. `Separate library-specific errors`: To build a flexible API, it is important to separate library-specific errors from those of the program. Doing so provides the flexibility to easily migrate the API database from SQLite to another RDBMS.

3. `Handle low-level errors`: For each potential error scenario, add low-level error handling - i.e. errors that can be caused by fetch_blog() - to detect and handle errors as close to the source as possible.

4. `Raise errors suitable to the level above`: After handling low-level errors, raise errors that are more suitable to the level above.

5. `Add custom exception types`: To provide more detailed and user-friendly error messages, add custom exception types for specific error scenarios. For example:
    - When a blog does not exist with the given ID, raise a `NotFoundError` exception.
    - When a blog does not have public access, raise a `NotAuthorizedError` exception.
